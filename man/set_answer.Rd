\title{Set an Answer and Confidence for a Leaf Node}
\usage{
set_answer(tree, node_name, response, confidence_level)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The `data.tree` object to be modified.}

\item{node_name}{A character string specifying the `name` of the leaf node to update.}

\item{response}{A logical value, `TRUE` or `FALSE`, representing the answer.}

\item{confidence_level}{A numeric value from 0 to 5 representing the user's
confidence in the answer.}
}
\value{
Returns the modified `tree` object invisibly, which allows for function chaining.
}
\description{
This is the primary function for providing evidence to the tree. It finds a
specific leaf node by its name and updates its `answer` and `confidence`
attributes based on user input.
}
\details{
The function takes a 0-5 confidence level from the user and converts it to an
internal score between 0.5 (uncertain) and 1.0 (certain) using the formula:
`score = 0.5 + (confidence_level / 10)`.

It includes validation to ensure the target node exists, is a leaf, and that
the provided response is a valid logical value. A confirmation message is
printed to the console upon successful update.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple tree
tree <- data.tree::Node$new("Root")
tree$AddChild("A1", answer = NA, confidence = NA)
tree$AddChild("A2", answer = NA, confidence = NA)

# Set an answer for leaf 'A1'
tree <- set_answer(tree, "A1", TRUE, 5)
print(tree, "answer", "confidence")

}
