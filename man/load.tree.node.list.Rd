\title{Build a decision tree from a nested list}
\usage{
load.tree.node.list(data_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{A nested R list representing the tree structure. Each list
element should have a `name` and can have other attributes like `question`,
`rule`, and a sub-list named `nodes` containing its children.}
}
\value{
A `data.tree` object, fully constructed and initialized with `answer`
  and `confidence` attributes set to `NA`.
}
\description{
This is the core function for converting a nested R list, typically
  generated by reading a YAML file, into a `data.tree` object. It constructs
  the tree hierarchy and initializes the `answer` and `confidence` attributes
  required for the analysis.
}
\details{
This function serves as a low-level constructor called by wrapper functions
like `load.tree.yaml()`. It uses `data.tree::as.Node()` to parse the list
structure and then traverses the new tree to set default `NA` values.
