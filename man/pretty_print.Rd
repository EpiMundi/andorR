\title{Print a Styled, Formatted Summary of the Decision Tree}
\usage{
pretty_print(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The `data.tree` object (the root `Node`) to be printed.}
}
\value{
The original `tree` object (returned invisibly).
}
\description{
Displays a clean, perfectly aligned, color-coded summary of the tree's
current state, with color propagation up the branches.
}
\details{
This function manually traverses the tree to construct the output line by
line, calculating the required padding for each line to ensure perfect
column alignment regardless of tree depth. It uses text markers and colors
to convey the state of each node.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'my_tree' is a loaded andorR tree object
pretty_print(my_tree)
}
