\title{Identify the Most Influential Question(s)}
\usage{
get_highest_influence(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The main \code{data.tree} object for the analysis. It is expected that
the \code{calculate_influence} function has already been run on the tree.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} (technically a tibble) containing the \code{name}, \code{influence_index}, and
\code{question} for the highest-influence leaf/leaves. Returns \code{NULL} invisibly if
no eligible (unanswered) questions remain.
}
\description{
Scans all leaf nodes in the tree to find the one or more questions that
currently have the highest \code{influence_index}. This is the core function for
guiding the user to the next most impactful question to answer during the
interactive analysis loop.
}
\details{
The function works by:
\enumerate{
\item Gathering all leaf nodes from the tree.
\item Filtering out any leaves that have already been answered or are part of an
already-resolved logical branch (where \code{influence_index} is \code{NA}).
\item Finding the maximum \code{influence_index} among the remaining eligible leaves.
\item Returning a data frame of all leaves that share this maximum score.
}
}
