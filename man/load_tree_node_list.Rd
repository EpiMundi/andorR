\title{Build a decision tree from a nested list}
\usage{
load_tree_node_list(data_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{A nested R list representing the tree structure. Each list
element should have a \code{name} and can have other attributes like \code{question},
\code{rule}, and a sub-list named \code{nodes} containing its children.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.tree} object, fully constructed and initialized with \code{answer}
and \code{confidence} attributes set to \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This is the core function for converting a nested R list, typically
generated by reading a YAML file, into a \code{data.tree} object. It constructs
the tree hierarchy and initializes the \code{answer} and \code{confidence} attributes
required for the analysis.
}
\details{
This function serves as a low-level constructor called by wrapper functions
like \code{load_tree_yaml()}. It uses \code{data.tree::as.Node()} to parse the list
structure and then traverses the new tree to set default \code{NA} values.
