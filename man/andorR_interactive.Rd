}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The `data.tree` object to be analysed.}
}
\value{
The final, updated `data.tree` object.
}
\description{
Iteratively prompts the user to answer questions to solve a decision tree.
The function first presents the most impactful unanswered questions. Once the
tree's root is solved, it presents questions that can increase the overall
confidence of the conclusion.
}
\details{
This function provides a command-line interface (CLI) for working with the
tree. It uses the `cli` package for formatted output and handles user input
for quitting, saving, printing the tree state, or providing answers to
specific questions (either by number or by name). All tree modifications are
performed by calling the package's existing API functions like `set_answer()`
and `update_tree()`.
