\title{Calculate Dynamic True/False Indices for a Parent Node}
\usage{
assign_indices(node)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{A `data.tree` `Node` object to be processed. The function will
only act on this node if it is not a leaf (`!node$isLeaf`).}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value; it modifies the input `node`
  by side-effect.
}
\description{
This function calculates a `true_index` and a `false_index` for a given parent
(non-leaf) node. The calculation is dynamic, depending on the node's logical
rule (`AND` or `OR`) and the number of its direct children that have not yet
been answered (i.e., their `answer` attribute is `NA`).
}
\details{
The function applies the following logic:
- For an **AND** node, `true_index` is `1/n` and `false_index` is `1.0`.
- For an **OR** node, `true_index` is `1.0` and `false_index` is `1/n`.

Where `n` is the number of unanswered children. If all children have been
answered (`n = 0`), `n` is treated as 1 to avoid division by zero.

The function modifies the node object directly by adding or updating the
`true_index` and `false_index` attributes. It is intended to be used with
`tree$Do()`.
