\title{Calculate the Influence Index for a Leaf Node}
\usage{
calculate_influence(node)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{A `data.tree` `Node` object, which must be a leaf.}
}
\value{
The function has no return value; it modifies the `influence_index`
  attribute of the input `node` by side-effect.
}
\description{
Determines the strategic importance (the "influence") of asking an unanswered
leaf question. The influence is calculated by aggregating the logical indices
(`true_index` and `false_index`) of all its ancestor nodes.
}
\details{
The influence index is a measure of how much a single leaf's answer can
contribute to the final conclusion. It is calculated as the sum of two
products:
Influence = `prod(ancestor_true_indices) + prod(ancestor_false_indices)`

The function will set `influence_index` to `NA` under two conditions,
as the question is considered moot:
1.  The leaf node itself has already been answered.
2.  Any of the leaf's ancestors has a determined `answer` (`TRUE` or `FALSE`),
    meaning the branch has already been logically resolved.

This function is intended to be used with `tree$Do(..., filterFun = isLeaf)`.
