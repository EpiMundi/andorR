\title{Print a Formatted Summary of the Decision Tree}
\usage{
print_status(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The `data.tree` object (the root `Node`) to be printed.}
}
\value{
The original `tree` object (returned invisibly).
}
\description{
Displays the `data.tree` object in the console with a custom set of columns
(`Rule`, `Answer`, `Confidence`) formatted for readability. This function is
the standard way to view the tree's state during an analysis.
}
\details{
This function provides a consistent, clean view of the tree's current state.
It formats the `Confidence` attribute to show the 0-5 scale for leaves
and a percentage for parent nodes. It also hides `NA` values for all
attributes to reduce clutter.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'my_tree' is a loaded andorR tree object
print_tree_status(my_tree)
}
