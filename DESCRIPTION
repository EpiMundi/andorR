Description: A decision support tool to strategically prioritize evidence gathering 
  in complex, hierarchical 'AND-OR' decision trees. It is designed for situations 
  with incomplete or uncertain information where the goal is to reach a confident 
  conclusion as efficiently as possible (responding to the minimum number of 
  questions, and only spending resources on generating improved evidence when 
  it is of significant value to the final decision). The framework excels in 
  complex analyses with multiple potential succesful pathways to aonclusion 
  ('OR' nodes). Key features include a dynamic influence index to guide users to 
  the most impactful question, a system for propagating answers and 
  semi-quantitative confidence scores (0-5) up the tree, and post-conclusion 
  guidance to identify the best actions to increase the final confidence. 
  These components are brought together in an interactive command-line workflow 
  that guides the analysis from start to finish.
