Description: Tools for the analysis, visualisation and optimisation of AND-OR 
  decision trees, a logical structure consisting of YES/NO questions (the
  leaves) connected to a hierarchy of nodes, each with AND or OR logic. When
  enough questions have been answered, the responses propegate up the tree
  to result in a final YES or NO conclusion. This implementation includes 
  semi-quantitative measures of confidence (on a scale of 0 to 5) for each
  response. The package includes a tool to provide answers to specific questions, 
  an algorithm to select the optimal next question to minimise the number of
  questions required to solve the tree, and for a completed tree, an algorithm
  to determine which responses would have the most impact on the confidence of
  the final result, if the individual question confidence could be improved. 
  There are also functions to visualise the tree structure, save a tree to file, 
  functions to load a defined tree from multiple different formats. It also 
  includes an interactive tool to automate the process of responding to 
  questions, recalculating the tree and selecting the optimal next step.
